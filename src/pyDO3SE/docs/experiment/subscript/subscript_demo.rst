Photosynthesis based stomatal resistance (R :sub:`sto` )

The objective of the coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model (
A :sub:`net` -g :sub:`sto` ) model is to quantify leaf or canopy scale g
:sub:`sto` with the help of easily accessible environmental parameters
such as air temperature (T :sub:`air` ), ambient CO :sub:`2`
concentration (c :sub:`a` ) and irradiance (*PAR*).  The A :sub:`net` -g
:sub:`sto`  model consists of a combination of two separate models,
whose main components are outlined below and include i. the empirical A
:sub:`net` -g :sub:`sto` model that estimates g :sub:`sto` (Leuning,
1990) and ii. the mechanistic and biochemical Farquhar model (Farquhar
et al., 1980) that estimates net carbon assimilation or net
phostosynthesis (A :sub:`net` ).
