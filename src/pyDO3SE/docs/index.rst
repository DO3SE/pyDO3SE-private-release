Contributing to this documentation:
-----------------------------------
To contribute to this documentation first determine which section you need
to contribute to.
The documentation uses .rst files which are then built using Sphinx.
We also autoconvert word files(See below) and autogenerate a pdf (See below).
When changes have been made and pushed to the git repository these are autobuilt by CircleCi.
CircleCi then pushes the built documentation to the gh-pages branch.
The built documentation can then be viewed at https://sei-do3se.github.io/pyDO3SE/



Note: We have modified the sphinx default makefile to add production building.


Build and deploy documentation
------------------------------

To deploy the documentation merge changes with master or RELEASE branches.
The documentation is then built with CircleCI and pushed to the gh-pages branch.
