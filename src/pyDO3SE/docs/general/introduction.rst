Introduction
==================

-  Describe what the DOSE model is designed to do: estimate both total
   ozone deposition for mass balance and stomatal ozone flux for risk
   assessment add schematic(s) .... (add how and by whom it has been
   used/implemented so far? i.e. EMEP, MM, individuals etc.)…
-  Describe how the DOSE model has evolved (refer to Table 1) and the
   versions that exist as the model has developed and, more recently,
   for different applications. Describe possible differences between
   site-specific and EMEP/national scale model….largely (?) related to
   availability of input meteorology….i.e. when this is modelled (as
   opposed to measured) complete dataset of more variables tend to be
   available though with a lower local scale reliability…when measured
   datasets tend to be more limited in data compliment though would be
   expected to be more representative of the local conditions….
-  Describe what needs will ideally be met by the development of this
   interfaced version this sounds very much as if the main scope of this
   document is on the interface – is this what we want?
-  Give brief details of “support” provided with this interfaced model
   (i.e. e-mail address for people who should be contacted when all goes
   wrong)….
-  Add a sentence on ownership of model?
