   Thermal time is used to define the time based on accumulated
   temperature change.

   “Leaves are assumed to grow and senesce at a rate determined by the
   thermal time integral of the mean daily temperature(Thermal Time)
   above a base temperature of 1\ :sup:`o`\ C” (Porter 1984). We use a
   base temperature of 0\ :sup:`o`\ C within the Ewert Model.

   Currently we calculate thermal time(TT) based purely on the
   accumulated average daily external temperature as below:

    

   Where  and T is the hourly recorded ambient temperature

   t is the current time and t\ :sub:`b` is the base temperature.

      :name: calculating-age-in-thermal-time

   To calculate the age in thermal time (TT:sub:`a`) we find the
   accumulated time between the thermal time value at the start of the
   growing season (TT:sub:`0`) and the current thermal time as below

   Where t\ :sub:`0` is the time of the start of the growing season
