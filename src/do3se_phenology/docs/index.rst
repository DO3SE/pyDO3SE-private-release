Contributing to this documentation:
-----------------------------------
To contribute to this documentation first determine which section you need
to contribute to.
The documentation uses .rst files which are then built using Sphinx.
We also autoconvert word files(See below) and autogenerate a pdf (See below).
When changes have been made and pushed to the git repository these are autobuilt by CircleCi.
CircleCi then pushes the built documentation to the gh-pages branch.




Note: We have modified the sphinx default makefile to add production building.
